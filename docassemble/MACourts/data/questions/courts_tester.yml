    How do I pick a court?
  content: |
    If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
    get to choose your court. But if you are starting a new case, you have
    a choice. How do you know which court to choose?
  
    Massachusetts has 7 trial court departments:
    
    * District Court
    * Boston Municipal Court (BMC)
    * Superior Court
    * Housing Court
    * Probate and Family Court
    * Juvenile Court
    * Land Court
    
    The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
    any type of case. The Land Court, Probate and Family, Juvenile Court, and
    Housing Court are all **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
    They have may have judges with special training as well as special 
    resources available.
    
    For example, the Housing Court has trained mediators, a special
    program for tenants with disabilities, and legal help available on-site
    on the day that eviction hearings are held.
    
    Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
    can give you every kind of help. For example, you cannot file a housing
    discrimination case in the District Court. You can only ask for visitation
    in the Probate and Family Court.
    
    Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
    your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
    but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
    courts.
    
    Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
    as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
    
    Only you know the right choice.
    
    You can also view the court selection guidance at [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/courthouse-locator).
